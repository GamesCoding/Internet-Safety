Identity theft is the purposeful use of another person's identity. This is 
usually for financial advantages. For example, the person who would commit 
the crime would use the victim's finances to buy items in the victim's name.

This is due to the fact that they can find and use specific information to 
impersonate people. We will dive more into this in the next <a href="#sub-heading2">topic</a>.

We can avoid this by refraining from giving this kind of data on the internet.
Private information that reveal who you are in the real world should be kept to yourself
and those trusted by you. You should also turn on notifications for any payments that are 
made in your name.

Remove any data online that is very private for you to stay safe on the internet.
Don't use unsecured wifi networks either (explaination why in the next <a href="#sub-heading2">topic</a>).

If you are outside at a cafe for example, you would sometimes use the free wifi. This is
dangerous if the wifi is unsecured/unencrpted. It would be like a gateway to hackers to
your emails containing credit card numbers, social security numbers, etc. leading to
identity theft.

When your identity is stolen, the person (or people) that have stolen your identity act as if
they were you to fool others, to your disadvantage, or something even more critical.

This individual (or group) would take advantage of any (mostly financial) information they 
can find on you, to use it for their own benefits.

The people who track this kind of data on you are called cyber stalkers. 
We will focus more on them in the next <a href="#sub-heading3">topic</a>.

Cyber stalkers are people that would track you on the internet, to humiliate you, threaten you,
or they might have even more cruel intentions. 

Like we spoke about in the first <a href="#sub-heading1">topic</a>, it is best to keep your
financial information to yourself and/or with the people you trust. This would 
greatly protect the private information about yourself and maybe even the information of others.

Don't overshare information about yourself online either or keep your account private.
Protect all accounts with a strong password. You can also protect them by adding
2-step verification (if the website or app has an option to do so).

Usually the people who cyber stalk do this know you so it is best to report
this to your school, workplace or to the police.

General software updates are important as they patch many holes in the software. This would
include patches to critical security holes.

Malwares usually take advantage of <q><ins>dents</ins></q> in the system.
Very harmful malwares would generally go for the vulnerablities in the software of operating
systems and browsers.

Phishing scams are basically scams that would lure you into giving your private
and/or sensitive data. This is done by someone sending you an email, text/SMS, or calling
you directly <q>promising</q> you something if you take a survey,
or the website itself would be programmed to phish your data.

You can protect yourself by ignoring or reporting these messages and just keeping away
from such scams.

Remember, not to fall for such tricks and to stay safe on the internet. Commiting these 
cyber crimes could land you in prison (18+ for jail, below 18 for juvenile).
